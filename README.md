# Automated Temperature Tester PMDC

## Overview
The Automated Temperature Tester PMDC project utilizes an Arduino Nano 33 BLE, a K-Type Thermocouple, a Max6675.h Breakout Board, a slip ring, and a 3D printed fixture. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for assembly, wiring, and usage of the automated temperature test labview program.

## Components
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- K-Type Thermocouple
- Max6675.h Breakout Board
- Slip Ring
- BLED112 USB Dongle
- Customized Shims for Bearing
- Customized Shims for Different Frame Size
- 3D Printed Fixtures

## Description
This automated tester device serves as transmitter that sending temperature data through air using Bluetooth Low Energy module to the host labview program (Eng lab computer/Desktop/Automated Temp Test/PM Automated Temperature Test Final).
